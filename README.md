# poor-mans-smu
Part of my efforts to create a "poor man's SMU", ref https://poormanssmu.wordpress.com/

The code in this repo is currently only a UI prototype. It uses displays and libraries I have worked with before. Refer to by blog entries in the 'display' category: https://weatherhelge.wordpress.com/category/display/

It works togehter with Arduino + EasySMU (DC2561A) and 5" capacitive touch screen.

The schematics directory contains various schematics that have been scanned from other sources.
Just to keep it somewhere. The scehematics are not related to the code at all.
